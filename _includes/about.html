              <h2>About Brandon</h2>

                <p> I began my journey into programming as a vital creative endeavor, a way to work and create simultaneously. </p>

                <p> I come from a teaching background. My traditional degree is in English and Education and for the past four years I have been a middle school teacher, teaching 7-8th grade English and History.
                  I have always had a drive to help people and to lead them to better and stronger senses of self. In code I seek to do the same.
                </p>

                <p> I was drawn to web development because I realized the power the breadth that the web had to offer. The growth of the web and the increased
                access to it appeal to my sense of broad outreach. I hope to be able to use the web to reach people in meaningful and compelling ways.
                </p>
